# AirTune

AirTune is an innovative Android application that enables users to control their device's media playback, screen brightness, and volume through intuitive, hands-free gestures. It's designed for anyone seeking a more convenient, hygienic, or touch-free way to interact with their smartphone, especially when their hands are occupied, dirty, or simply not free to touch the screen.


## Features

- ### Hands-free Media Control  (Play, pause, skip tracks with gestures)
- ### Intuitive Brightness Adjustment (Control screen brightness without touching)
-  ### Precise Volume Management (Adjust device volume using gestures)
- ### Seamless Background Operation (Works even when app is not in foreground or screen is off)
- ### Responsive Gesture Recognition (Utilizes advanced recognition for quick commands)


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/soumya9832/AirTune.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd AirTune
```

#### Open and Run in Android Studio
### 1. Open Project:

- Launch Android Studio.
- Select "Open an existing Android Studio project" (or "File" > "Open...").
- Navigate to and select the AirTune folder you just cloned.

### 2. Gradle Sync:

- Android Studio will automatically start a Gradle sync to download all necessary dependencies and set up the project. Wait for this process to complete. If it doesn't start automatically, look for a "Sync Project with Gradle Files" icon (often a refresh button with a Gradle elephant icon) in the toolbar.
### 3. Run the App:

- Connect an Android device to your computer (ensure Wireless / USB debugging is enabled on the device).
- OR, select an Android Emulator from the device dropdown in Android Studio's toolbar.
- Click the "Run" button (green play icon) in the toolbar.
